Creates a new (nearly) REST API to expose all models of Re2o. See [the dedicated wiki page](https://gitlab.federez.net/federez/re2o/wikis/API/Raw-Usage) for more details on how to use it.
* For testing purpose, add `volatildap` package:
```
pip3 install volatildap
```
* Activate HTTP Authorization passthrough in by adding the following in `/etc/apache2/site-available/re2o.conf` (example in `install_utils/apache2/re2o.conf`):
```
    WSGIPassAuthorization On
```
* Activate the API if you want to use it by adding `'api'` to the optional apps in `re2o/settings_local.py`:
```
OPTIONAL_APPS = (
    ...
    'api',
    ...
)

## MR 177: Add django-debug-toolbar support

Add the possibility to enable `django-debug-toolbar` in debug mode. First install the APT package:
```
apt install pyhton3-django-debug-toolbar
```
And then activate it for Re2o by adding the app to the `OPTIONAL_APPS` in `re2o/settings_local.py`:
```python
OPTIONAL_APPS = (
    # ...
    'debug_toolbar',
    # ...
)
```
If you to restrict the IP which can see the debug, use the `INTERNAL_IPS` options in `re2o/settings_local.py`:
```
INTERNAL_IPS = ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"]
```

## MR 174 : Fix online payment + allow users to pay their subscription

Add the possibility to use custom payment methods. There is also a boolean field on the 
Payments allowing every user to use some kinds of payment. You have to add the rights `cotisations.use_every_payment` and `cotisations.buy_every_article`
to the staff members so they can use every type of payment to buy anything.

Don't forget to run migrations, several settings previously in the `preferences` app ar now
in their own Payment models.

To have a closer look on how the payments works, pleas go to the wiki.
