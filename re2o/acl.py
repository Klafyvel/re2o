# this ! ðŸŒˆðŸ˜¸
def acl_base_decorator(method_name, *targets, on_instance=True):
    """Base decorator for acl. It checks if the `request.user` has the
    permission by calling model.method_name. If the flag on_instance is True,
    tries to get an instance of the model by calling
    `model.get_instance(obj_id, *args, **kwargs)` and runs `instance.mehod_name`
    rather than model.method_name.

    It is not intended to be used as is. It is a base for others ACL
    decorators. Beware, if you redefine the `get_instance` method for your 
    model, give it a signature such as 
    `def get_instance(cls, object_id, *_args, **_kwargs)`, because you will
    likely have an url with a named parameter "userid" if *e.g.* your model
    is an user. Otherwise, if the parameter name in `get_instance` was also
    `userid`, then `get_instance` would end up having two identical parameter
    passed on, and this would result in a `TypeError` exception.

    Args:
        method_name: The name of the method which is to to be used for ACL.
            (ex: 'can_edit') WARNING: if no method called 'method_name' exists,
            then no error will be triggered, the decorator will act as if
            permission was granted. This is to allow you to run ACL tests on
            fields only. If the method exists, it has to return a 2-tuple
            `(can, reason, permissions)` with `can` being a boolean stating
            whether the access is granted, `reason` an arror message to be
            displayed if `can` equals `False` (can be `None`) and `permissions`
            a list of permissions needed for access (can be `None`). If can is
            True and permission is not `None`, a warning message will be
            displayed.
        *targets: The targets. Targets are specified like a sequence of models
            and fields names. As an example
            ```
                acl_base_decorator('can_edit', ModelA, 'field1', 'field2', \
ModelB, ModelC, 'field3', on_instance=False)
            ```
            will make the following calls (where `user` is the current user,
            `*args` and `**kwargs` are the arguments initially passed to the
            view):
                - `ModelA.can_edit(user, *args, **kwargs)`
                - `ModelA.can_change_field1(user, *args, **kwargs)`
                - `ModelA.can_change_field2(user, *args, **kwargs)`
                - `ModelB.can_edit(user, *args, **kwargs)`
                - `ModelC.can_edit(user, *args, **kwargs)`
                - `ModelC.can_change_field3(user, *args, **kwargs)`

            Note that
            ```
                acl_base_decorator('can_edit', 'field1', ModelA, 'field2', \
on_instance=False)
            ```
            would have the same effect that
            ```
                acl_base_decorator('can_edit', ModelA, 'field1', 'field2', \
on_instance=False)
            ```
            But don't do that, it's silly.
        on_instance: When `on_instance` equals `False`, the decorator runs the
            ACL method on the model class rather than on an instance. If an
            instance need to fetched, it is done calling the assumed existing
            method `get_instance` of the model, with the arguments originally
            passed to the view.

    Returns:
        The user is either redirected to their own page with an explanation
        message if at least one access is not granted, or to the view. In order
        to avoid duplicate DB calls, when the `on_instance` flag equals `True`,
        the instances are passed to the view. Example, with this decorator:
        ```
            acl_base_decorator('can_edit', ModelA, 'field1', 'field2', ModelB,\
ModelC)
        ```
        The view will be called like this:
        ```
             view(request, instance_of_A, instance_of_b, *args, **kwargs)
        ```
        where `*args` and `**kwargs` are the original view arguments.
